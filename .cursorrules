# Cursor Rules for Hierarchical Multi-Agent Retrieval System

# PhD Research Repository - Fall 2026 Applications

> **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: These rules are also available as:
> - `AGENTS.md` - Universal format for Claude Code, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and other assistants
> - `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code-specific rules
> - `.claude/commands/` - Slash commands for Claude Code
> 
> **All configuration files are PRIVATE REPOSITORY ONLY** - Never commit to public repository

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Most Common Commands

```bash
# Check which repository you're working with
git remote -v

# Push documentation to public repository
git push origin main

# Push implementation to private repository
git push private main

# Verify before pushing
git diff --name-only
```

### Critical Rules (Always Follow)

1. **Never modify existing code** without explicit user approval
2. **Always check repository** before push: `git remote -v`
3. **Public repo = Documentation only** (no implementations)
4. **Private repo = Full code** (everything)
5. **No credentials ever** in any repository
6. **NEVER delete `.cursorrules` file** - This file is critical for project workflow
7. **`.cursorrules` is PRIVATE ONLY** - Never commit to public repository (already in `.gitignore-public`)

### File Quick Check

| File Type                    | Public Repo | Private Repo |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| `README.md` (from README-PUBLIC.md) | ✅ Yes (architecture only) | ✅ Yes (full setup) |
| `SETUP.md`                   | ❌ Never    | ✅ Yes       |
| `README-PUBLIC.md`           | ❌ Never (source file only) | ✅ Yes (local workspace) |
| `*.md`, `*.pdf` (docs)       | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes       |
| `*.py` (structure only)      | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No        |
| `*.py` (with implementation) | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes       |
| `.env`, `.key`, `*_test.py`  | ❌ Never    | ✅ Yes       |
| `diagrams/`, `research/`     | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes       |
| `requirements.txt`, `*.lock` | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes       |

### Emergency Recovery

```bash
# Accidental push to wrong repo
git push [remote] --delete [branch-name]

# Exposed credentials
1. Delete branch immediately
2. Rotate credentials
3. Audit entire repository
```

### Quick Push Decision Tree

```
Is it documentation/research/diagrams?
  → YES: git push origin main
  → NO: Continue...

Does it contain implementation code?
  → YES: git push private main (private only)
  → NO: Continue...

Is it a Python structure file (signatures only)?
  → YES: git push origin main
  → NO: Ask for clarification
```

## 1. Repository Purpose & Context

This is a research artifact for PhD applications demonstrating a production-scale hierarchical multi-agent retrieval system with 1M+ documents processed and 10,000+ users served. The system showcases theoretical foundations for scalable multi-agent coordination with semantic coherence preservation.

**Target Programs**: UT Austin, Texas A&M, Rice University, UW-Madison, Georgia Tech
**Research Focus**: Multi-agent systems, scalable information retrieval, distributed AI coordination
**Applicant**: Ateya - ML Engineer with 7+ years software engineering, 2+ years ML/MLOps specialization

## 2. Core Principle: Preservation Over Modification

**CRITICAL**: The system already works. No code changes without explicit instruction.

- **Never** modify, refactor, or restructure existing code
- **Never** add dependencies, packages, or libraries
- **Never** rename files, move directories, or change project structure
- **Never** delete `.cursorrules` file - This is a protected project configuration file
- **Only** work on documentation, research materials, and repository organization

**Protected Files (Never Delete):**
- `.cursorrules` - Cursor IDE workflow configuration (PRIVATE REPOSITORY ONLY)
- `AGENTS.md` - Universal AI assistant rules (PRIVATE REPOSITORY ONLY)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code-specific rules (PRIVATE REPOSITORY ONLY)
- `.claude/` - Claude Code commands, agents, and configuration (PRIVATE REPOSITORY ONLY)
- `HUMAN_REPO_GUIDELINES.md` - Human workflow reference (PRIVATE REPOSITORY ONLY)
- `AI_ASSISTANT_SETUP.md` - AI assistant setup guide (PRIVATE REPOSITORY ONLY)
- `.gitignore-public` - Public repository exclusion template

**All AI Assistant Configuration Files:**
- Excluded from public repository via `.gitignore-public`
- Never commit to public repository (origin)
- Only exist in private repository (private)

When suggesting improvements, always state:

> "This would require your explicit approval to implement. Should I proceed?"

## 3. Dual-Repository Strategy

This project uses two repositories for academic transparency while protecting implementation details:

### Public Repository (Documentation & Research)

**Purpose**: PhD application showcase, academic review, research dissemination

**Allowed Content**:

- Complete documentation and architecture explanations
- Research papers, theoretical foundations, complexity analysis
- System design diagrams and architectural visualizations
- README files, setup guides, deployment documentation
- Class signatures and interface definitions (structure only)
- Performance benchmarks and scalability analysis
- Academic contributions and novel approaches

**File Extensions Allowed**:

```
.md, .pdf, .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .svg, .gif, .tex
.py (structure only - class signatures with pass, no implementations)
.yaml, .json (configuration templates only, no real values)
```

**Prohibited Content**:

- Function implementations with business logic
- Actual algorithms and proprietary optimizations
- Real configuration files with credentials
- Test implementations and internal tooling
- Dependency lock files and build artifacts

### Private Repository (Full Implementation)

**Purpose**: Complete codebase with full implementations and business logic

**Content**: Everything - full production code, tests, configurations, security mechanisms

**Access**: Available upon request to academic reviewers at ateyaterence@gmail.com

**Protected Configuration Files (Private Repository Only):**
- `.cursorrules` - This file (Cursor IDE workflow configuration) - **NEVER DELETE**
- `AGENTS.md` - Universal AI assistant rules (Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.) - **NEVER DELETE**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude Code-specific rules - **NEVER DELETE**
- `.claude/` - Claude Code commands and agents directory - **NEVER DELETE**
- `HUMAN_REPO_GUIDELINES.md` - Human workflow reference - **NEVER DELETE**
- `AI_ASSISTANT_SETUP.md` - AI assistant setup guide - **NEVER DELETE**
- `.gitignore-public` - Public repository exclusion template

**IMPORTANT**: These files are excluded from public repository via `.gitignore-public` and should only exist in the private codebase.

## 3.5. README File Structure & Management

**CRITICAL**: The project uses separate README files for public and private repositories to maintain proper separation of concerns.

### README File Organization

**In Local Workspace:**
- `README.md` - Current file (contains full setup instructions, for private repo)
- `README-PUBLIC.md` - Public-friendly version (architecture-focused, no setup details)
- `SETUP.md` - Detailed setup instructions (for private repo reference)

**For Public Repository (origin):**
- `README.md` - Must be the public-friendly version
  - Contains: Portfolio header, architecture overview, research contributions
  - Does NOT contain: Detailed setup, environment configs, deployment steps, troubleshooting
  - Source: Copy from `README-PUBLIC.md` or use its content

**For Private Repository (private):**
- `README.md` - Full documentation with setup instructions
- `SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide (optional, can be separate or part of README.md)

### Rules for Updating README Files

**When User Requests README Updates:**

1. **Always determine context first:**
   ```bash
   # Check which repository context
   git remote -v
   ```

2. **For Public Repository Updates:**
   - Update `README-PUBLIC.md` in local workspace
   - Content must be: Architecture-focused, research-oriented, no implementation details
   - Never include: Setup steps, environment variables, deployment commands, troubleshooting
   - When pushing: Copy `README-PUBLIC.md` to `README.md` before pushing to public repo

3. **For Private Repository Updates:**
   - Update `README.md` or `SETUP.md` in local workspace
   - Can include: Full setup instructions, environment configs, deployment guides, troubleshooting
   - Implementation details are allowed

4. **When User Says "Update README":**
   - Ask: "Is this for public repo (architecture/research) or private repo (setup/implementation)?"
   - OR check `git remote -v` to infer context
   - Update the appropriate file based on context

### README Content Guidelines

**Public README (`README-PUBLIC.md` → `README.md` in public repo):**
```
✅ Portfolio header with PhD application context
✅ System architecture overview
✅ Technology stack (high-level)
✅ Research contributions
✅ Performance metrics (1M+ docs, 10K+ users)
✅ Links to research documentation
✅ Academic contact information
❌ Detailed setup instructions
❌ Environment variable configurations
❌ Deployment step-by-step guides
❌ Troubleshooting sections
❌ Testing instructions
```

**Private README (`README.md` in private repo):**
```
✅ All public README content PLUS:
✅ Complete setup instructions
✅ Environment configuration details
✅ Deployment guides
✅ Troubleshooting sections
✅ Testing instructions
✅ Component-specific READMEs
```

### File Update Workflow

**Scenario: User wants to update README for public repo**

```bash
# 1. Update README-PUBLIC.md in local workspace
# 2. Copy to README.md for public repo
cp README-PUBLIC.md README.md

# 3. Verify content (no setup details)
# 4. Stage and commit
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs(readme): update architecture overview for PhD review"

# 5. Push to public repository
git push origin main
```

**Scenario: User wants to update README for private repo**

```bash
# 1. Update README.md or SETUP.md in local workspace
# 2. Can include full setup details
# 3. Stage and commit
git add README.md SETUP.md
git commit -m "docs(readme): add complete deployment instructions"

# 4. Push to private repository
git push private main
```

**Scenario: User wants to update both**

```bash
# Update public version
# Edit README-PUBLIC.md (architecture/research focus)
cp README-PUBLIC.md README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs(readme): update architecture for public repo"
git push origin main

# Update private version
# Edit README.md or SETUP.md (full setup details)
git add README.md SETUP.md
git commit -m "docs(readme): update setup instructions for private repo"
git push private main
```

### Critical Warnings

**NEVER:**
- Mix public and private README content
- Include setup instructions in public README
- Include environment variables in public README
- Push `SETUP.md` to public repository
- Push `README-PUBLIC.md` as-is to public (must rename to `README.md`)
- Delete `.cursorrules` file (protected configuration file - PRIVATE REPOSITORY ONLY)
- Commit `.cursorrules` to public repository (already excluded in `.gitignore-public`)

**ALWAYS:**
- Check repository context before updating README
- Verify content matches repository purpose (public = architecture, private = setup)
- Keep `README-PUBLIC.md` and `SETUP.md` separate in local workspace
- Use appropriate file when pushing to each repository

## 4. Repository Detection & Safety

### Before ANY Git Operation

**ALWAYS** check the current repository context:

```bash
# Required first step before any push
git remote -v
```

**Decision Logic**:

- If remote = `origin` → Public repository (documentation only)
- If remote = `private` → Private repository (full implementation allowed)
- If uncertain → STOP and ask user to clarify

### Push Command Pattern

```bash
# Private repository (full code)
git push private main
git push private dev

# Public repository (documentation only)
git push origin main
git push origin docs/architecture-update
```

## 5. Content Validation for Public Repository

Before pushing to public repository, verify:

### File Extension Check

```
✅ Allowed: .md, .pdf, .png, .jpg, .svg, .py (structure), .yaml (template)
❌ Blocked: .env, .key, .pem, _test.py, .lock, .toml, .sql
```

### Python File Validation

Public repository `.py` files must contain ONLY:

- Import statements
- Class definitions with `pass` in methods
- Function signatures with `pass` in body
- Type hints and docstrings
- No actual implementations

Example of allowed Python in public repo:

```python
from typing import List, Dict
from pydantic import BaseModel

class OrchestratorAgent:
    """Hierarchical agent orchestration with semantic coherence preservation."""

    def __init__(self, config: AgentConfig):
        """Initialize orchestrator with configuration."""
        pass

    def route_task(self, query: str, context: Dict) -> TaskPlan:
        """Route task to appropriate sub-agent based on query analysis.

        Args:
            query: User query string
            context: Conversation and system context

        Returns:
            TaskPlan with agent assignments and coordination strategy
        """
        pass
```

### Sensitive Data Patterns

Never push content containing:

- `api_key`, `password`, `secret`, `token` assignments
- Database connection strings
- Stripe keys or payment credentials
- Google service account JSON
- Personal user data

## 6. PhD Application Documentation Standards

### Required Documentation Elements

Every component should have clear documentation including:

**1. Problem Statement**

- What problem does this component solve?
- Why is this architecturally significant?
- What are the scalability challenges?

**2. Architectural Design**

- High-level system design
- Component interactions and data flow
- Technology choices and rationale

**3. Theoretical Foundations**

- What research principles guide this design?
- How does it relate to existing work?
- What are the novel contributions?

**4. Performance Characteristics**

- Complexity analysis (time/space)
- Scalability properties
- Bottlenecks and optimization strategies

**5. Production Evidence**

- Real-world deployment metrics (1M+ docs, 10K+ users)
- Lessons learned from production operation
- Trade-offs and engineering decisions

### Documentation Style

**Tone**: Professional academic, technically precise, research-oriented

**Audience**: PhD admissions committees, faculty reviewers, academic researchers

**Focus Areas**:

- Systems thinking and architectural reasoning
- Bridge between theory and practice
- Research potential and intellectual depth
- Engineering maturity and production experience

**Avoid**:

- Marketing language or sales pitches
- Unsubstantiated claims
- Overly casual tone
- Implementation minutiae without context

## 7. Research Contribution Framing

When documenting this system for PhD applications, emphasize:

### Novel Contributions

- Hierarchical multi-agent coordination preserving semantic coherence
- Scalable information retrieval across distributed document processing
- Production-validated approaches to RAG at scale
- Theoretical foundations for multi-agent system coordination

### Research Questions Addressed

- How to maintain semantic coherence in distributed multi-agent retrieval?
- What are the theoretical guarantees for hierarchical agent coordination?
- How to scale RAG systems to millions of documents with user quality?
- What are the trade-offs in agent autonomy vs. centralized orchestration?

### Academic Impact

- Demonstrates transition from theoretical understanding to production systems
- Shows ability to identify and solve open research problems
- Provides evidence of systems-level thinking
- Illustrates research methodology from problem to deployment

## 8. Academic Access Protocol

### Providing Access to Private Repository

When academic reviewers request full code access:

**Step 1**: Verify the request includes:

- Requester's full name and position
- Academic institution affiliation
- GitHub username
- Specific research purpose

**Step 2**: Grant private repository access via:

- Email: ateyaterence@gmail.com
- Response time: <24 hours for academic requests
- Method: GitHub collaborator invitation

**Step 3**: Communicate access terms:

- Academic use only, no redistribution
- Citation required if used in publications
- Access duration: 6 months (renewable)
- Confidentiality of implementation details

### Access Request Template (for documentation)

Do NOT generate this automatically. Only reference it when user asks about access procedures:

```
Required Information:
- Full name and academic position
- University/Institution affiliation
- Research purpose and intended use
- GitHub username for repository access
- Confirmation of academic-only use
```

## 9. Branch Strategy

### Private Repository Branches

- `main` - Stable production code
- `dev` - Development branch
- `feature/*` - New features (with implementations)
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates

### Public Repository Branches

- `main` - Public documentation and research
- `docs/*` - Documentation improvements
- `research/*` - Academic papers and analysis

## 10. Dual-Repository Push Workflow

### Repository Setup

**Set up both remotes in your local repository**:

```bash
# Add public repository as 'origin' (default)
git remote add origin git@github.com:t-ateya/hierarchical-multi-agent-retrieval-system.git

# Add private repository as 'private'
git remote add private git@github.com:t-ateya/hierarchical-multi-agent-retrieval-system-impl.git

# Verify both remotes are configured
git remote -v
```

### Automatic File Routing by Category

**Category 1: PUBLIC ONLY** (Always push to public repository)

```
Documentation:
✅ README.md, *.md files in /docs
✅ /docs/academic/, /docs/deployment/, /docs/structure/
✅ /research_development/ (papers, diagrams, benchmarks)

Media & Diagrams:
✅ *.png, *.jpg, *.svg, *.pdf (architecture diagrams)
✅ /diagrams/, /assets/, /figures/

Structure Files:
✅ *.py files (structure only - signatures with pass)
✅ LICENSE, .gitignore, CONTRIBUTING.md
✅ *.yaml, *.json (template configurations only)
```

**Category 2: PRIVATE ONLY** (Never push to public repository)

```
Implementation:
❌ *.py files with actual function implementations
❌ /tests/, *_test.py, conftest.py, pytest.ini
❌ /src/ with business logic

Configuration:
❌ .env, .env.example with real values
❌ *.key, *.pem, *.cert (credentials)
❌ docker-compose.yml with real configurations
❌ /config/ with production settings

Dependencies:
❌ requirements.txt, poetry.lock, package-lock.json
❌ Pipfile.lock, pyproject.toml

Build Artifacts:
❌ __pycache__/, *.pyc, .pytest_cache/
❌ /dist/, /build/, *.egg-info/
```

**Category 3: BOTH REPOSITORIES** (Push to both, different versions)

```
Root Files:
- README.md (public: from README-PUBLIC.md, private: full setup)
- SETUP.md (private only: detailed setup instructions)
- .gitignore (public: documentation focus, private: full)
- docker-compose.yml (public: template, private: full)
- .env.example (public: commented template, private: real structure)

Python Structure:
- *.py (public: signatures only, private: implementations)

IMPORTANT: README.md differs between repos:
- Public: Copy from README-PUBLIC.md (architecture/research focus)
- Private: Full README.md with setup instructions OR separate SETUP.md
```

### Standard Push Commands

**For Documentation Updates** (Public Repository):

```bash
# Check current changes
git status

# Stage documentation files only
git add docs/ README.md *.md diagrams/ research_development/

# Push to public repository
git push origin main
```

**For Code/Implementation** (Private Repository):

```bash
# Stage all changes including implementations
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "feat(agents): implement hierarchical orchestration"

# Push to private repository
git push private main
```

**For Simultaneous Updates** (Both Repositories):

```bash
# Make changes to both documentation and code
git add .
git commit -m "refactor(system): restructure agent coordination

- Update architecture documentation

```

**Before pushing to PRIVATE repository**:

```
☐ Run: git remote -v (confirm pushing to 'private')
☐ Check: All tests pass locally
☐ Verify: Sensitive data is in .env (not committed)
☐ Confirm: Code quality meets production standards
```

### Automated Push Helper Commands

**Add these to your shell configuration** (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):

```bash
# Push documentation to public repository
alias push-public='git remote -v && echo "Pushing to PUBLIC repo..." && git push origin $(git branch --show-current)'

# Push code to private repository
alias push-private='git remote -v && echo "Pushing to PRIVATE repo..." && git push private $(git branch --show-current)'

# Push to both (use with caution)
alias push-both='git remote -v && echo "Pushing to BOTH repos..." && git push origin $(git branch --show-current) && git push private $(git branch --show-current)'

# Check what would be pushed
alias push-check='echo "=== PUBLIC ===" && git diff origin/main --name-only && echo "\n=== PRIVATE ===" && git diff private/main --name-only'
```

### Common Push Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Added Research Paper**

```bash
# File: research_development/papers/hierarchical-agents.pdf
git add research_development/papers/hierarchical-agents.pdf
git commit -m "research(papers): add hierarchical agent coordination paper"
git push origin main  # PUBLIC ONLY
```

**Scenario 2: Updated Architecture Documentation**

```bash
# File: docs/academic/architecture.md
git add docs/academic/architecture.md
git commit -m "docs(architecture): expand multi-agent coordination section"
git push public main  # PUBLIC ONLY
```

**Scenario 3: Fixed Bug in Implementation**

```bash
# File: src/agents/orchestrator.py (with implementation)
git add src/agents/orchestrator.py tests/test_orchestrator.py
git commit -m "fix(orchestrator): resolve task routing deadlock"
git push private main  # PRIVATE ONLY
```

**Scenario 4: Added Python Structure File**

```bash
# File: src/agents/orchestrator.py (signatures only)
# This goes to BOTH but with different content

# For public: Create structure-only version
cat > src/agents/orchestrator.py << 'EOF'
from typing import Dict, List
from pydantic import BaseModel

class OrchestratorAgent:
    """Hierarchical orchestration for multi-agent coordination."""

    def __init__(self, config: Dict):
        """Initialize orchestrator with configuration."""
        pass

    def route_task(self, query: str) -> str:
        """Route task to appropriate sub-agent."""
        pass
EOF

git add src/agents/orchestrator.py
git commit -m "structure(agents): add orchestrator agent interface"
git push origin main

# For private: Add full implementation
# (work in private repo with full code)
git push private main
```

**Scenario 5: README Update**

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Use README-PUBLIC.md for public, README.md/SETUP.md for private

# Public README: Focus on architecture and research
# Step 1: Update README-PUBLIC.md in local workspace
# Step 2: Copy to README.md for public repo
cp README-PUBLIC.md README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs(readme): update architecture overview for PhD review"
git push origin main

# Private README: Include full setup instructions
# Update README.md or SETUP.md in local workspace
git add README.md SETUP.md
git commit -m "docs(readme): add complete deployment instructions"
git push private main
```

### Git Commit Message Standards

Use conventional commit format for academic professionalism:

```
type(scope): brief description

- Detailed explanation of changes
- Research implications or architectural rationale
- References to related work or design decisions
```

**Commit Types**:

- `docs` - Documentation updates (README, guides, research papers)
- `research` - Research materials (papers, benchmarks, analysis)
- `structure` - Code structure and interfaces (public repo)
- `feat` - New features (private repo only)
- `fix` - Bug fixes (private repo only)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring (private repo only)
- `test` - Test additions (private repo only)

**Examples**:

```
docs(architecture): add hierarchical agent coordination design

- Explain orchestrator pattern for multi-agent system
- Include complexity analysis and scalability properties
- Reference related work in distributed AI systems

research(papers): add theoretical foundations for semantic coherence

- Survey existing approaches to multi-agent coordination
- Identify gaps addressed by hierarchical design
- Provide formal problem statement

structure(agents): define retrieval agent interface

- Add base class for specialized retrieval agents
- Document semantic coherence requirements
- Include type hints for agent communication protocol
```

## 11. File Organization Standards

### Documentation Structure

```
/docs
├── academic/           # Research-focused documentation
│   ├── research.md    # Main research overview
│   ├── architecture.md # System architecture
│   ├── theory.md      # Theoretical foundations
│   └── evaluation.md  # Performance analysis
├── deployment/        # Deployment guides
│   └── guides/        # Platform-specific instructions
└── structure/         # Project organization
    └── DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md
```

### Research Materials

```
/research_development
├── papers/            # Academic papers and citations
├── diagrams/          # Architecture visualizations
├── benchmarks/        # Performance evaluations
└── related_work/      # Literature review and comparisons
```

## 12. Communication Protocol

### When User Requests Repository Operations

**For Push Operations**:

```
"Checking repository context..."
"Remote detected: [origin/private]"
"Repository type: [Private/Public]"
"Content validation: [✅ All checks passed / ❌ Issues found]"
"Ready to push to [repository]. Proceed? [y/N]"
```

**For Content Validation Failures**:

```
"🚨 CONTENT VIOLATION: [specific issue]"
"File: [filepath]"
"Issue: [description]"
"Action: Aborting push to public repository"
"Recommendation: [how to fix]"
```

### When Suggesting Improvements

**Always frame as questions**:

```
"I notice [observation]. This could be improved by [suggestion].
However, this would modify existing code.
Should I:
a) Proceed with changes
b) Create documentation of the improvement
c) Skip this suggestion"
```

## 13. PhD Application Talking Points

Public repository should support these claims in applications:

### Technical Depth

- "Built production-scale hierarchical multi-agent system processing 1M+ documents"
- "Designed theoretically grounded coordination mechanisms for distributed agents"
- "Implemented with MLOps best practices: monitoring, testing, deployment automation"

### Research Potential

- "Identified open problem: semantic coherence in distributed multi-agent retrieval"
- "Developed novel hierarchical coordination approach with formal foundations"
- "Validated approach in production serving 10,000+ users"

### Systems Thinking

- "Architected scalable RAG pipeline with modular, independently deployable components"
- "Balanced theoretical rigor with engineering pragmatism"
- "Demonstrated end-to-end systems development from research to production"

### Academic Preparation

- "MS in Computer Science, specialized ML/AI training at Caltech"
- "Published work in educational AI systems for underserved communities"
- "Experience bridging academic research and production deployment"

## 14. Safety & Recovery

### If Accidental Push to Wrong Repository

**Immediate Actions**:

```bash
# Delete the pushed branch
git push [remote] --delete [branch-name]

# Force push corrected version
git push [remote] [branch-name] --force
```

**If Sensitive Data Exposed**:

1. Delete branch immediately
2. Rotate any exposed credentials
3. Review entire repository for other exposures
4. Consider repository deletion if widespread exposure

### Repository History Audit

Periodically verify public repository contains no sensitive data:

```bash
# Search entire history for patterns
git log -p | grep -i "api_key\|password\|secret"

# Check all file types
git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only | grep -E "\.(env|key|pem)$"
```

## 15. Best Practices for Research Repositories

### Documentation Quality

- Write for PhD committee readers, not just developers
- Include motivations and design rationale, not just "what"
- Reference academic literature where relevant
- Show awareness of research landscape

### Code as Communication

- Even structure-only code should be readable and well-documented
- Class and function names should reflect architectural concepts
- Comments should explain design decisions, not implementation

### Professional Presentation

- Consistent formatting and style
- No TODO comments or "hack" annotations in public repo
- Clean commit history without "WIP" or "fix typo" messages
- README files that guide academic reviewers effectively

### For Recommenders:

```
Subject: PhD Application - Technical Portfolio for Reference

Hi [Professor/Recommender],

I'm applying to CS PhD programs with a focus on autonomous agent systems
and retrieval-augmented generation. I've created detailed technical documentation
of my research work:

Comprehensive Documentation:
https://github.com/[username]/[repo]/blob/main/research_readme.md

Research Statement (shorter):
https://github.com/[username]/[repo]/blob/main/research.md

Key contributions:
- Hierarchical multi-agent architecture with specialized sub-agents
- Production-scale RAG system with long-term memory
- Safe tool orchestration framework
- Deployed with authentication, billing, and observability

The documentation includes detailed technical analysis and future research
directions. Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thank you for supporting my application!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### For Application Portals (if URL field limited):

```
Technical Portfolio: https://github.com/[username]/[repo]/blob/main/research_readme.md
```

### In Your SOP (reference):

```
For detailed technical documentation of my multi-agent system work, please see:
https://github.com/[username]/[repo]/blob/main/research_readme.md

## ⚠️ Common Questions

### Q: Which file should I share with committees?
**A**: Share **research_readme.md** as primary URL. It's comprehensive, scientific, and designed for committee review.

### Q: Do I need to share all files?
**A**: No! Committees will follow links from research_readme.md if they want to see code. You just need to provide the one main URL.

### Q: What's the difference between research_readme.md and research.md?
**A**:
- **research_readme.md**: Scientific documentation style, 25 pages, comprehensive technical analysis
- **research.md**: Research statement style, 15 pages, includes pre-written SOP paragraphs

Both are good! research_readme.md is more thorough for committees. research.md is better for recommenders and SOP material.

### Q: Can I use both?
**A**: Yes! Use research_readme.md as primary link, and reference research.md in your SOP for specific paragraphs.

### Q: Which Research Direction should I use?
**A**: Read APPLICATION_STRATEGY.md - it explains how to match directions to school strengths. When in doubt, use Direction 1 (Multi-Agent Coordination).

### Q: How do I know what research areas a school emphasizes?
**A**: APPLICATION_STRATEGY.md has a 15-minute research process for each school.

### Q: Do I need to know faculty names?
**A**: NO! The strategy is designed for applying WITHOUT knowing specific reviewers.
